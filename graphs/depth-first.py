"""Depth-First Search"""
# Depth-First searches are a (bad) way to find if two nodes in a graph are connected.
# Graphs are represented as follows:
# {
# "A": ["B", "C"]
# "B": ["A", "C"]
# "C": ["A", "B"]
# }

# Becomes:
# (A) --
#  |    \
#  |   (B)
# (C) -/

#Â Basically, the nodes are stored in a dictionary, with each node equalling a list of the connected nodes.

# The example graph look like so:
# +---+A+
# +     +---+
# B+--+     C
# +   |     +
# +   |     +
# D   +----+E
# +     +---+
# +---+F+
